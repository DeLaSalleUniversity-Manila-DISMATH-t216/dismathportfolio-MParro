## Week 1
- I was introduced to a new and interesting course called **Discrete Mathematics** (DISMATH)
- Our professor (Sir Melvin Cabatuan) told us that our project will be a mobile application which makes the course more interesting.
- I was introduced to logic and proofs and learned that **proposition** is a statement that is neither true (1) nor false (0) and there is NO in between!
- I've learned the logical connectives which are shown in the table below: 

| Operator       |  Symbol               | Usage    | 
| :-------------:|:---------------------:|:--------:| 
| Negation       |  ¬                    | not      | 
| Conjunction    |  ∧                    | and      | 
| Disjunction    |  V                    | or       | 
| Exclusive or   |  ⊕                   |  xor     |    
| Conditional    |  →                    | if, then |
| Biconditional  |  ↔                    | iff      | 

- I've also learned how to use these logical connectives in truth tables.
