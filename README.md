## Week 1
- I was introduced to a new and interesting course called **Discrete Mathematics** (DISMATH)
- Our professor (Sir Melvin Cabatuan) told us that our project will be a mobile application which makes the course more interesting.
- I was introduced to logic and proofs and learned that **proposition** is a statement that is neither true (1) nor false (0) and there is NO in between!
