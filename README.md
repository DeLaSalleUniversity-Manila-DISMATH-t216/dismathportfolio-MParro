## Week 1
- I was introduced to a new and interesting course called **Discrete Mathematics** (DISMATH)
- Our professor (Sir Melvin Cabatuan) told us that our project will be a mobile application which makes the course more interesting.
- I was introduced to logic and proofs and learned that **proposition** is a statement that is either true (1) or false (0) and there is NO in between!
- I've learned the logical connectives which are shown in the table below:

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator     | Shorthand | Formula                                       | Logical Expression             |
| :-------------: |:---------------------:|:---------:|:---------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------:|
| ¬               | Negation              | not       | val(¬p) = 1 - val(p)                          | ¬p                             |
| ∧               | Conjunction           | and       | val(p ∧ q) = min(val(p), val(q))              | p ∧ q                          |
| v               | Disjunction           | or        | val(p v q) = max(val(p), val(q))              | p v q                          |
| ⊕              | Exclusive disjunction | xor       | if val(p)  not equal val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0|  p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
| →               | Conditional           | if, then  | if val(p)  ≤ val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0        | p → q ≡  ¬p v q                |
| ↔               | Biconditional         | iff       | if val(p) equals val(q) = 1 , otherwise  0    |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p)     |

- I've also learned how to use these logical connectives in truth tables.


## Week 2
- I've learned about the laws and rules in DISMATH called Logical Equivalences. These are:
  - Identity laws
  - Domination laws
  - Negation laws
  - Double Negation law
  - Idempotent laws
  - Commutative laws
  - Associative laws
  - Distributive laws
  - De Morgan's laws
  - Absorption laws
- I've also learned **Propositional logic** which deals with propositions as a whole (subject + predicate)
- I've also learned about **Quantifiers** which indicates the generality of an open sentence in which a variable occurs. 
- Quantifiers have two classifications:
  - Existential Quantifiers (∃x)
    - "There exist"
  - Universal Quantifiers (∀x)
    - "For all"
